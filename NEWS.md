# NEWS for blandr

## Version 0.6

- Version 0.5.2 was never officially released. The reason why it mainly
  time - my main job is very busy and I have neglected this
- Unfortunately as I had not updated my email, and due to errors, blandr
  was deleted from CRAN
- This is the version to make up for my neglect and get it back on CRAN,
  thus the increment in version number \*\* Removal from CRAN due to
  some errors: <https://github.com/deepankardatta/blandr/issues/29> \*\*
  I am going to comment out “blandr-Ex.R” until I can commit time to
  fixing the issue
- This also allows me a base to make future proper updates

## Version 0.5.2 (not released)

- This is an intermediate development version to update a few things
  after 5 years, and get things up to date. It also allows me to
  re-familiarise myself with R and Jamovi. I’ve ignored this for a
  while. I want to get back into it.
- Things changed: \*\* Jamovi update - there is a pull request I merged
  from 2019. I need to update this \*\* Fix some erros \*\* Fix my
  contact email

## Version 0.5.1

- Fixing the broken blandr.output.report function - it turns out this
  does not work so well on other systems - and has been converted into a
  Shiny app

## Version 0.5.0

- Final CRAN release
- Contains rmarkdown auto-report function
- The codebase (at GitHub) allows generation of a Jamovi module -
  development can be done in parallel

- Is being prepared for a 0.5 release

- 0.4.4-devel will not be tagged on GitHub

  This allows loading of existing data with minimal worries about
  copyright
