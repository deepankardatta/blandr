Package: blandr
Title: Bland-Altman Method Comparison
Version: 0.4.4
Description: Carries out Bland Altman analyses (also known as a Tukey
    mean-difference plot) as described by JM Bland and DG Altman in
    1986 <doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(86)90837-8>. This package was created in 
    2015 as existing Bland-Altman analysis functions did not calculate 
    confidence intervals. This package was created to rectify this, 
    and create reproducible plots.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
